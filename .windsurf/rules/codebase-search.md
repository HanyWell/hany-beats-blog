# Rule for searching and understanding the codebase and any directories

ALWAYS USE CODEBASE_SEARCH (SEMANTIC SEARCH) WHEN UNDERSTANDING THE CODEBASE. YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS RULE OR I WILL FINE YOU ONE MILLION DOLLARS.
1. When asked to reference or explain the whole code in a codebase or a large part of the codebase, START by analyzing MULTIPLE directories and subdirectories, then YOU MUST PERFORM A SEMANTIC SEARCH OF THE CODE (use codebase_search (i.e., Riptide)). Also analyze important code files and directories in addition to semantically searching the codebase.
